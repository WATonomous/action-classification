# Model Zoo

Trained models are released in the Google drive folder [`model_zoo`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lTej6EaBjl7bSAeIvcXyOD0qvXXmrST3?usp=sharing), and should be downloaded to this local `model_zoo` folder by default for evaluation.

Additional notes:
- Original mAPs (the column "Orig mAP") are results of evaluation with out-dated dependencies (torch <=1.3 and ffmpeg 3.X).
- Re-evaluated mAPs (the column "Re-eval mAP") are obtained with more recent packages (torch 1.8.1 and ffmpeg 4.4).
